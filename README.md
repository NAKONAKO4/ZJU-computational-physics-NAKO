## Purpose

This repository is a dedicated space for staging my homework for the ZJU Computational Physics course. It serves as a personal learning source, where I can document my work and progress throughout the course. 

## Copyright and Anti-Plagiarism Policy

To ensure academic integrity, all homework assignments will be **uploaded after their respective due dates**. This approach helps to prevent any potential plagiarism and ensures that the work remains original. Once the homework deadline has passed, the assignments will be made **public** for anyone who is interested in reviewing the solutions and learning from the approach taken.

By uploading the homework after the due date, I also aim to protect the intellectual property of my work and contribute to the educational community in a responsible manner.

## Usage

Feel free to browse the repository, but please remember that it is intended solely for educational purposes. Reusing or copying the content directly without understanding it is discouraged. Instead, I encourage others to learn from the code and problem-solving techniques.

Thank you for respecting this policy.
